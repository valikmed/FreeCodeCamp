Attributes
*An attributes is a value placed inside the opening tag of the HTML element.
Attributes provide additional information about the elemet or specify how the element should behave.*

###### Example 1:
`<div id="root"></div>`
Where `<div>` is a tag that is open and ready to pass `id` that is an attribute and `"root"`  that is a value and at the end we need to close our tag by writing `</div>`.

###### Example 2:
`<a href="https://www.example-website.com">Visit our website</a>`

All in tag `<a></a>` is an element, and `href` is attribute inside of we have value that is `"https://www.example-website.com"` link


###### Example 3:
`<img src="image.jpg" alt="A beautiful image" />` why we haven't tag that close tag when we open, it is because `<img />` tag is void type

All in tag `<img />` is an element.
`src` and `alt` are attributs
`"image.jpg"` and `"A beautiful image` are values


###### Example 4:

`<input type="checkbox" checked />` all in `<input />` is element with type `void`. 
`type` and `checked` are attributs, and `checked` is boolean attribute like `disabled`
`"checkbox"` is value
